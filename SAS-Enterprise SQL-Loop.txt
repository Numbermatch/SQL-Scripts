*This is a SAS enterprise program. It may be the case that loops like this exist in other SQL environments, but I am not aware at this time.

*This program works to create a cumulative interest rate from a table of durational interest rates. Mechanically speaking, this program creates an 
*initial table (from a table called "Interest_Rate") and links that table on itself repetitively. 

*While there are simpler solutions for this problem, I find the concept of linking a table to itself in-loop very powerful. For example, for restructuring data or self-referencing tables.
